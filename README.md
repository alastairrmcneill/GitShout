# GitShout README

GitShout is an extension to remind you not to do all your work on the main branch but to switch onto a feature branch! Sometimes I need shouted at for this!

1. Install the extension
2. If you start editing a file while on Main or Master branch then you will be notified.
3. If you want different branches then head over to the GitShout Settings to add your own specific branches.
